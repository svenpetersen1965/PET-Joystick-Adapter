# PET-Joystick-Adapter
A C64/VIC-20/Atari Joystick Adapter for the Commodore PET. It supports the Coyote Electronics pin configuration (two joysticks) and the space invader/break put style pin configuration (left, right, fire), found on zimmers.net (https://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/pet/games/english/joy/index.html).

The Coyote Electronics pin configuration is also called "PET User port adapter" in the VICE emulator, so it is expected to be wide spread. Space Invader + is the completed pin configuration of the previously mentioned games and can also be found on the "stupid little PET tricks" adapter. Hence the name. 
All joystick games found in the previously mention source could be played with this joystick adapter.

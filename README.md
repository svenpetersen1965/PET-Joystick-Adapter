# PET-Joystick-Adapter
A Joystick Adapter for the Commodore PET. It supports the Coyote Electronics pin configuration (two joysticks) and the space invader style pin configuration, found on zimmers.net (https://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/pet/games/english/joy/index.html).

The Coyote Electronics pin configuration is also called "PET User port adapter" in the VICE emulator, so it is expected to be wide spread. All joystick games found in the previously mention source could be played with the adapter.
